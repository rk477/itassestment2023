		<br>
		<p>Health centers receive Health Center Program federal grant funding to improve the health of underserved populations. Some health centers receive funding to focus on special populations, including individuals and families experiencing homelessness, migratory and seasonal agricultural workers, and residents of public housing. There are also health centers that meet all Health Center Program requirements but do not receive federal award funding.
